# WWPT(Wuthering Waves Plate Tracker)
Thank you for downloading WWPT! 
While I tried my best to make this program user-friendly, there were many limitations. Thus, I will write this README file that guides you step by step through all the programs that are required.

## Notice
1. This program DOES NOT access or alter any game files.
2. The database uses pseudo-authentication process, so please don't try to break through :)

## Prerequisites Walkthrough
1. If you do not have Python installed, please install the distributions I have packed together in the "Python" folder. One is for Windows, and the other is for Mac.
2. Open your command prompt. This can be done with typing in "cmd" in search, or Win+R and typing in cmd.
3. Copy your current directory that has this project downloaded. This can be done by clicking the address bar on the top, similar to an address bar you would see in Chrome or Safari. Be noted that if you move these files to somewhere else, you may need to re-install, so please make sure this project is downloaded to a safe and fixed place.
4. In the command prompt, type in:
`cd "your-directory"`
for example, the directory for my own project would look like:
`cd "C:\Users\username\Desktop\GIT\WWPT"`
then press enter. You will see that the directory has now changed. "cd" means change directory, btw.
5. Type in:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
and the command will start installing a lot of files. Be noted that this may take 5-10 minutes, as the required files are large.
6. All done!

## If you're lazy...
This python file has to be manually "run" for it to work.
